Bearing fault dataset collected by Jiangnan University. The test rig uses the PCB MA352A60 acceleration sensor to collect vibration signals in the vertical direction. The sampling frequency is 50 kHz, and the rotational speeds are 600 r/min, 800 r/min, and 1000 r/min, respectively. Using wire cutting processing technology, 0.3 mm × 0.05 mm (width × depth) tiny dents were processed on the outer ring, inner ring and roller of the rolling bearing on the test bench to simulate the failure of the outer ring, inner ring and rolling ball.
